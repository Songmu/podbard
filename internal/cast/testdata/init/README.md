# Your Podcast Site

## What to do next

1. Congiguration
    - adjust the `podbard.yam` file to fit your podcast site
    - locate `static/images/artwwork.jpg` if you like
2. Locate the audio files (MP3 or M4A)
    - put the audio files in the `audio/` directory (You should remove the sample files)
3. Locate the episode files (Markdown)
    - put the episode files in the `episode/` directory (You should remove the sample files)
    - Hint: You can use the `podbard episode <your.mp3>` subcommand to create a new episode file
4. Build the site
    - run `podbard build` to build the site to the `public/` directory
